# PHP-authentification-example
My login and registration scripts made in PHP.

They allow registration of new users to database and login of existing users.

This is an updated version of a project that I made few months ago, I made this version
because I wasnt happy with the old version as it didn't reflect my current knowledge of OOP and MVC.

Old version can be found in the 0LDVERSION file of this repo,I decided to keep it to show my progress.
